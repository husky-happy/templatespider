The Dual Dovetail Adapter replaces the standard PVS-14 “J” arm to transform the user experience with PVS-14 goggles into a superior Anti-Wobble interface elevated to achieve ultimate reliability and stability. Maximizing custom-fit operator capability through heightened adjustment capacity—the Dual Dovetail Adapter retains peak readiness via fully sealed circuitry and rapid right-eye to left-eye transition. While the typical “J” arm adapter is subject to vacillating while in motion, the Dual Dovetail Adapter remains steadfast even through high-velocity operation, permitting unwavering performance and limiting wobble induced eye fatigue. The True Horizontal Adjust (THA) feature further expands field use through achieving the ideal NVG position with one-half inch infinite horizontal adjustment. In elevating the Dual Dovetail Adapter’s rugged durability, sealed circuitry permits exceptional water resistance to prevent short out. Right-eyeleft-eye compatibility ensures accelerated conversion ability, or for enhanced performance simply attach a second dovetail to achieve on-the-fly right-eyeleft-eye command. In reaching towards the climax of high-performance night vision helmet mount systems, the Dual Dovetail Adapter enhances PVS-14 goggle use through expanding the capability of the typical “J” arm in becoming an Anti-Wobble juggernaut with intensified comfortable wear while ensuring endurable operational proficiency.
