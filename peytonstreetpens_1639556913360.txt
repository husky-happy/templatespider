The cutouts in the barrel and cap give you a nice view of the inside of the pen, and if there was a sac installed, you could see it compress and expand as the lever is raised and lowered. There are no cutouts in the section, and it isn't fixed in place, so if you find the correct sized nib, feed, and sac, this could be a working pen. The only caveat is that the cap cutouts might cause the ink to dry up, but it's also possible that the section extends far enough into the cap liner that it will keep the nib from drying out between uses.", "detail_cat": "Home/Sheaffer/Flat-Top Celluloid/Sheaffer Lifetime Flat Top Demonstrator Oversized (Rare) - Jade Celluloid, Cut-Outs, No Nib (Superior, Nonworking)", "id": "c8a4cb32f04f9276ca5c30625419e313", "images": ["https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-5ko0zosub2/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/11533/13670/flattop_cutaway_green_1__56051.1606155731.jpg?c=1"], "is_deleted": 0, "lastCrawlTime": "2021-12-15 16:28:29", "measurements": ["Weight: None", "Height: None", "Length: None", "Depth: None"], "name": "Sheaffer Lifetime Flat Top Demonstrator Oversized (Rare) - Jade Celluloid, Cut-Outs, No Nib (Superior, Nonworking)", "original_price": "400.00", "sku_list": [], "source": "peytonstreetpens.com", "updated": 1639556909, "url": "https://www.peytonstreetpens.com/sheaffer-lifetime-flat-top-demonstrator-oversized-rare-jade-celluloid-cut-outs-no-nib-superior-nonworking.html"}, "url": "https://www.peytonstreetpens.com/sheaffer-lifetime-flat-top-demonstrator-oversized-rare-jade-celluloid-cut-outs-no-nib-superior-nonworking.html"}, {"detection_infos": ["【images】只检查第一张图片", "【sku_list】字段为空, 请去网站检查T.T", "【source:peytonstreetpens.com】没有空格,请判断是否把字段内容中的空格清洗掉,未清洗掉请跳过T.T", "【brand】重要字段不存在！请注意检查,原网站是否含有该字段内容~~~~~~~~~~"], "items": {"brand": "", "cat": "Chilton Pneumatic Filler - BCHR Ring Top, Red End, Flexible Fine Nib (Excellent, Restored)", "created": 1639556912, "current_price": "280.00", "description": "Description Show Reviews Type Vintage collectible fountain pen in near mint working condition Product Name Unknown Manufacturer and Year Chilton, Boston, Massachusets, 1925-6 Length 5\" Filling System Pneumatic filling system.
